# This repository is a portfolio of my past machine learning records.

---
##
This directory uses the library segmentation-models-pytorch to perform chip segmentation.

## mnist_num
This directory uses the mnist dataset to recognize handwriting. The framework is based on Keras.


## YOLO.ipynb
this file uses YOLOv8 models. Performs a variety of image recognition.


## dog_vs_cat.py
It learns images of a dog and a cat on Kaggle's dataset and judges each of them. The framework is based on Keras.


## horse_01.py
Scraping past race data from sites that post horse race results, I use scikit-learn and Pytorch's NN model to predict race results.
